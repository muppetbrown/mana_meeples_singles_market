# API Connection Issue Fix

## The Problem
Your React app is still trying to connect to `localhost:10000` instead of using the production API URL `https://manaandmeeples.co.nz/api`.

## Root Cause
React apps embed environment variables at **build time**, not runtime. Even though you have `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://manaandmeeples.co.nz/api` set in your Render environment, the app was likely built before this environment variable was properly configured.

## The Fix

### Updated Code
I've enhanced the API configuration in `mana-meeples-shop/src/config/api.js` with:
1. Better debugging logs to show what's happening
2. More robust fallback logic for production deployments
3. Force production API URL when running on non-localhost domains

### Required Actions in Render

1. **Verify Environment Variable**: In your Render dashboard, confirm that `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://manaandmeeples.co.nz/api` is set.

2. **Trigger a Fresh Build**: You need to rebuild your app with the environment variable available at build time:
   - Go to your Render service dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" to trigger a fresh build
   - OR make a small code change and push to trigger an automatic deploy

3. **Check Console Logs**: After deployment, open your browser's developer console and look for messages like:
   ```
   üîç API URL Resolution Debug:
   üîó Final API URL configured as: https://manaandmeeples.co.nz/api
   ```

## Why This Happened
React's build process replaces `process.env.REACT_APP_*` variables with their actual values during build. If the environment variable wasn't available during the build, it gets replaced with `undefined`, causing the fallback to localhost.

## Testing
After rebuilding, your console should show the production API URL instead of localhost, and the connection errors should be resolved.
